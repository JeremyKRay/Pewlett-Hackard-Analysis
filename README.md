# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to assist Pewlett Hackard in preparing for what is being dubbed the "silver tsunami", a large incoming wave of retiring employees in the near future. To do this, multiple tables containing employee and department are examined using SQL to determine the number of employees reaching retiring age and their titles. In addition, since these numbers are quite large, the same data is analyzed to identify employees who may be eligible to participate in a mentorship program. These are presented as two deliverbles: 1) The number of Retiring Employees by Title and 2) A list of employees eligible for the Mentorship Program. 
#### Deliverable 1
For Deliverable 1, I first created and inserted into a table all of the employees and their titles that were reaching retirement age. This required a join of the Pewlett Hackard Employees table and the Pewlett Hackard Titles table. The resulting, Retirement_Titles table, can be viewed by clicking on the following link ![Retirement_Titles](Data/retirement_titles.csv). As you can see, there are several employees, each with a unique emp_no, that are duplicated because they have held more than one title since their hire_date. This skews our results as we actually really only care about what the retiring employee's current title is. To determine this, a second table was created, unique_titles, that used the SQL Distinct ON and Order By functions to order the employees by their unique emp_no and their to_date, or the date that they left a particular position and start a new position. A to_date of '9999-01-01' means that the employee is still employed under that particular title and this is the record that is selected. The unique_titles table can be viewed by clicking the following link ![Unique_Titles](Data/unique_titles.csv). Finally, a count was done on this table clearly showing the number of employees retiring from their current position or title. This can be seen in the retiring_titles table by clicking the following link ![Retiring_Titles](Data/retiring_titles.csv). 
#### Deliverable 2
For Deliverable 2, a table was created by also joining the Employees table and the Titles table but also the Dept_Emp table. The same Distinct on and Order by functions were used but this time it was filtered by a latter birth_date. This produced a table of eligible mentors and their department title that have been with the company a significant amount of time but are not quite to retirement age. This table can be viewed by clicking the link ![Mentorship_Eligibility](Data/mentorship_eligibility.csv).
## Results
### There are four major points to be gathered from the two deliverbles
  * 1) The "silver tsunami" is real and is coming. There are a total of 72458 employees reaching retirement age for Pewlett Hackard.
  * 2) Senior Engineers will be the hardest hit losing 25916 employees to retirement, followed closely by Senior Staff losing 24926 staff.
  * 3) There are 411 Senior Engineers and 278 Senior staff eligible for the Mentorship Program.
  * 4) Managers seem to be in the best position to ride the "silver tsunami" wave as there are only 2 Managers close to retirement age. 
## Summary
To summarize, 72,458 total roles will need to be replaced following the "silver tsunami" of retirements and only 1,549 retirement-ready employees to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees. Just looking at the two hardest hit departments, Senior Engineers and Senior Staff, there would be 1 mentor for every 63 and 90 employees to train as replacements, respectively. This would be a daunting task and unfortunately, it appears as though Pewlett Hackard does not have enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the depratments to mentor the next generation of employees.
